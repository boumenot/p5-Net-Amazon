        returning the currency code, and unformatted price.
   (cb) Patch by Carl Franks <fireartist@gmail.com> to address the confusion
        between release date, and publication date.  Prior to version 0.44
        release date was the publication date.  Now release date is the
        release date, and a function to return the publication date has been
        added.

0.43 (06/20/2007)
   (cb) Simon Wistow <simon@thegestalt.org> found an bug with wishlist

        the wishlist test can actually pass.

   (cb) Add scripts to automatically generate the canned test data.
   (cb) Serge Dubrouski <sergeyfd@gmail.com> noted an inconsistency in the 
        documentation for ImageUrl{Small,Medium,Large}.  When I converted to

        names, and keep the new functions around.

0.41 (04/10/2007)

        Music properties whereby track data were not correctly captured, and

   (cb) UPC accepts a search index, so process it.

        were from Frank Tobia <frank.tobia@gmail.com>.
   (cb) Add searches for director and title, contributed by Carl Franks
        <fireartist@gmail.com>.

0.39 (02/18/2007)
   (cb) Update documentation, 10-digit vs. 13-digit ISBN was incorrect.
   (cb) Add support for searching by EAN.  This is only valid for 
        non-US locations.  Suggested by Nick Faarvang.

   (cb) README is generated from Amazon.pm, update Amazon.pm with the
        changes made to README, and regenerate README. 
   (cb) Mike Schilli found a bug with non-US locales for Reviews where
        TotalVotes was always zero.  This caused a bogus warning.

0.36 (01/09/2007)
   (cb) Christopher Boumenot is taking over has maintainer of Net::Amazon.
   (cb) Update the library to use AWS4 from AWS3.  The changes involved
        are quite deep.  While I have strived to keep interfaces the same
        that was not always possible.  I am sure there are still bugs
        to be had that need to be fixed.
   (cb) Add searching by Author, Actor, MusicLabel, and Publisher.  
   (cb) Add the property functions numpages(), dewey_decimal(), and
        SuperSaverShipping().
   (cb) Add new property classes for CE (consumer electronics), Software,
        and VideoGames.
   (cb) Restrucure the fetch code to reduce the need to directly poke
        the XML where applicable.  There is still cleanup that needs to
        be done.
   (cb) Remove the need to explicitly specify mode parameters.
   (cb) Autogenerate libraries based on data from Amazon's ECS specs to
        determine a default mode for the user.
   (cb) Autogenerate libraries based on data form Amazon's ECS specs to
        determine the search types available for a given.  This 
        information is also locale specific.
   (cb) Cleanup locale support, and add support for France, and Canada.
        Locale support needs more testing.
   (cb) Add support for the different search response types in AWS4: 
        small, medium, large, similarities, reviews, etc.  The search 
        response type is automatically determined based on search mode.

0.35 (02/04/2006)

   (ms) Added similar_asins() to Net::Amazon::Property
   (ms) Steven Alyari reported a caching problem on v5.8.1-RC3/darwin,
        where perl's hashes are stored differently between invocations
        of the same program, confusing Net::Amazon's URL-based caching
        algorithm. Applied his fix, which sorts the query arguments.

0.33 (02/23/2005)
   (ms) Makefile.PL prerequisite changed from undef to '0'.
   (ms) Greg McCann <greg@cambria.com> added ThirdPartyProductInfo.

        CollectibleCount, NumberOfOfferings, UsedCount, ThirdPartyNewPrice,
        ThirdPartyNewCount as default properties. To get (*Count,

0.31 (09/22/2004)
   (ms) Lance P Cleveland <lance@lancecleveland.com> noticed that somewhere
        between 0.26 and 0.30 the properties() method lost the ability to 
        be called in scalar context and return only the first result. Added
        logic to re-enable it.

0.30 (09/14/2004)
   (ms) Lance Cleveland <lancec@proactivewm.com> provided a patch to
        fix a typo which caused N::A::Request::Similar to fail. Added more

        load errors on search(blended => ...), a fix for a bug with
        single/multiple ProductLine(s), and a suggestion for using
        ForceArray which XML::Simple. Added test cases for this patch.
   (ms) Added xml_parse() method to Net::Amazon::Response which Net::Amazon
        now calls to parse the returned XML. This enables the response
        class (which can override it) to creatively interpret the 
        response XML to form the response data structure.
   (ms) Added strict warnings to each and every module
   (ms) Added dump_responses() for easier response canning.

        method to the Book.pm property.
   (ms) Andy Grundman <andy@hybridized.org> provided a patch to

        Properties.pm that returns the browse_nodes (categories) for 
        a result.
   (ms) Dave Holland <dave@biff.org.uk> suggested to provide access
        to the user agent's proxy settings. Now, proxy settings via
        environment variables are supported (env_proxy()) as well as
        passing Net::Amazon->new(); a prepped LWP::UserAgent instance
        via the 'ua' parameter (see docs).
   (ms) Accessors are no longer created in the constructors, but on the
        package level. Thanks to tony@tmtm.com who reported this to the

   (ms) Tatsuhiko Miyagawa <miyagawa@livedoor.jp> provided a patch to
        adapt N:A for Amazon's change of "locale=jp" requests, which 
        should be sent to xml.amazon.co.jp, instead of xml.amazon.com:

        request mode to 'heavy' for that. Now all properties have a
        review_set() method returning a
        Net::Amazon::Attribute::ReviewSet object, which in turn offers
        a reviews() method delivering a list of
        Net::Amazon::Attribute::Review objects. Check the man pages
        for details. eg/review shows an example.

0.12 (07/24/2003)
   (ms) Mike Evron <evronm@dtcinc.net> noticed that the SYNOPSIS code
        on the main documentation page had the wrong "search" syntax 
        -- thanks, Mike!
   (ms) Changed all tests to process canned data, live tests turned out
        to be too unreliable, due to Amazon's "best effort" responses.
        If you want the test suite to process live data, you need to
        set the environment variable NET_AMAZON_LIVE_TESTS.
        
0.11 (07/14/2003)
   (ms) Added 'Similar Searches' API

   (ms) Tests are using new wishlist 1XL5DWOUFMFVJ (Net::Amazon)
   (ms) Added tests with canned reponses

0.06 (06/07/2003)
   (ms) applied workaround for AMZN's wishlist bug: If a wishlist
     is longer than 10 items, AMZN returns the first 10 items with
     no indication if there's any followup pages. The workaround
     just tries to fetch another batch in case there's exactly 10 and 
     hides eventually encountered errors. 

   Dan Sully <daniel@electricrain.com> provided a patch
     to suppress a warning in case a music item isn't returning a 'year'
     field

   Barnaby Claydon <bclaydon@perseus.com> reported a couple of problems
   with wishlists, they're fixed by the following patches:

   (ms) Added new property Net::Amazon::Property::DVD

   (ms) Changed as_string() of default Net::Amazon::Property (used if
     we come across a 'Toy' or 'Video Game' category) to return
     a more human-readable format.

   (ms) Implemented retry strategy on Amazon's temporary errors, if we
     encounter one, we'll sleep for 1 sec and then retry at most
     twice.

   (ms) Accessors have been changed to return an empty string if 
     a value hasn't been specified in XML. Products without price and
     other anomalies won't cause perl warnings anymore.

0.05 (05/31/2003)
   Martha Greenberg <marthag@mit.edu> provided bug reports 
   and patches for
       * 'music' parameter for UPC searches (fixed in doc)
       * Net::Amazon::Property::Music now deals correctly with
         CDs by multiple artists.
       * missing documentation of 'locale' parameter

   (ms) Net::Amazon now takes the 'locale' parameter also in
   the main Net::Amazon object's constructor.

   Dan Sully <daniel@electricrain.com> provided a patch
   to check if a response indeed contains the {Details} hash.
